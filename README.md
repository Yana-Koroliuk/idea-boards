## Relevance

The IdeaBoards web application is a dynamic platform designed to facilitate idea generation, organization, and collaboration within teams or communities. It provides a streamlined approach to managing boards, sections, and ideas, enabling users to collaborate effectively on various topics and projects. This application is well-suited for team collaboration, brainstorming sessions, and community-driven projects, making it an essential tool for fostering innovation and communication in both professional and personal settings.

## Concept

Idea-boards is a versatile web application that allows users to create, manage, and interact with boards, sections, and ideas. Users can register, log in, and manage their accounts, while collaborating with others by creating and organizing ideas within specific boards and sections.

The application offers several features to enhance collaboration and idea management:
- **Boards**: users can create boards with specific titles and descriptions. Each board can contain multiple sections, making it easier to organize ideas by categories or themes.
- **Sections**: within each board, users can create sections that serve as categories or specific topics under which ideas are grouped.
- **Ideas**: users can post ideas within sections, vote on them, and edit or delete them as needed. This encourages active participation and collaboration among users.
- **Authentication and authorization**: the application uses JWT for secure authentication and ensures that users can only access and modify their own boards and ideas.
- **Frontend**: built using React, providing a responsive and interactive user interface that works seamlessly across devices.
